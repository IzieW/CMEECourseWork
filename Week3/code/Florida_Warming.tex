\section{Results}
        There appeared to be a positive correlation between temperature and time, with a 
        Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.533. 
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=.30]{FloridaPlot}
            \label{fig}
        \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        To see the signficiance of this correlation, we compared the observed correlation
        coefficient agaisnt a distribution of completely random correlation coefficients, 
        achieved through reshuffling our data 5000 times. 
        
        \begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{permutationplot}
        \end{center}
        \end{figure}

        Out of 5,000 randomely generated correlation coefficients, none of them were 
        greater than our observed correlation coefficient.
        Thus, the observed positive correlation between temperature and time has an 
        approximate asymptotic p-value of 0.00.
        Florida is getting warmer.
