# My CMEE Coursework Repository

This repository contains all my coursework and practicals from every Week in CMEE so far. All practicals and data here are taken from and guided by [TheMulQuaBio](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html)

## Languages 
All scripts and programs in this repository were written in Bash 5.0.17, R4.1.1, LaTeX (TexLiv 2019) and Python 3.8.10.

## Structure and Usage
This repository contains one directory for every week in the course. Each week contains its own learning topics and README.md files, which can assist in structure and usage for their respective parts (including dependencies and language). Weeks 4-11 (excluding week 7) are notably less developed, and mainly just here to show stable continuity of structuring principles.
