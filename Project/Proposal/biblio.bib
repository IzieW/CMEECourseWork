  NOTE = {In this blogpost, we explore the concepts of  embodiment, individuality, self-maintenance and sensorimotor agency within a cellular automaton (CA) environment. Whereas those concepts are central in theoretical biology and cognitive science, it remains unclear how such behaviors can emerge in a CA-like environment made only of low-level particles and physical rules. We present a novel set of tools (based on curriculum learning, diversity search and gradient descent over a differentiable CA) to automatically learn the rules leading to the emergence of such behaviors.  Our method is able to discover robust self-organizing agents with strong coherence and generalization to out-of-distribution changes, reminiscent of the robustness of living systems to maintain specific functions despite environmental and body perturbations.},
