"""Continued work from evolution and runs over 10 gradient environments.
Environments where creatures last for more than a few seconds seem to favour a meshy-gridlike
layout state.

Script is dedicated to exploring environmental configurations that could potentially help
preserve our swimmers. Exploration asks the fundamental question- Which types of evolutionary environments
and selection pressures favour a swimmer over a meshy grid?"""

# Preparation
from lenia_package import *

### 1. Very dispersed gradients with less intense negative growth
"""Trial intense gradients (ie. the not very diffuse gradients which were too harsh for creatures
to even live in) with a lower all around negative growth peak"""
